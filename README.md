What is Data Science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines principles from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data, enabling informed decision-making and predictions.

Key Components:
Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality by handling missing or inconsistent data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends in data.
Modeling and Algorithms: Developing predictive models using machine learning and statistical techniques.
Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of data to communicate insights.
Deployment and Monitoring: Implementing models in production and monitoring their performance.
Data Science is used across industries for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, and much more, driving innovation and efficiency.
